    "summary": "Hi! I'm a Bioinformatics Software Developer at Harvard Medical School. I am working on to support DARPA Panacea project which aims in developing new therapeutic drugs to block pain and inflammation using novel pharmacological platforms. My primary responsibilities are to develop and maintain existing RNA-Seq bulk/single-cell pipelines and also to develop new modules and integrate them into the pipelines using INDRA modelling systems developed at Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP).",

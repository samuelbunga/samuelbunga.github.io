    "summary": "Hi! I'm a Bioinformatics Software Developer at Harvard Medical School. I am working on supporting the DARPA Panacea project which aims in developing new therapeutic drugs to block pain and inflammation using novel pharmacological platforms. My primary responsibilities are to develop and maintain existing RNA-Seq bulk/single-cell pipelines and also to develop new modules and integrate them into the pipelines using INDRA modeling systems developed at the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP).",
